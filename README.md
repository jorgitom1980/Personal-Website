# Personal-Website
Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. 
We will focus on three main areas: the landing page, an about page, and a portfolio page.

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. 
The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and Javascript. You must use a GitHub repository.
